== README

This application just runs a very basic authentication mechanism.

=== Usage

If you want to use the existing structure in the repository you would need to do the following:

  * Rename your application in config/application.rb
  * Run 'rails g mongoid:config'

Also have a look at db/seeds.rb to see what is being created in the database if you run 'rake db:seed' for the default users / roles.

Enjoy!
